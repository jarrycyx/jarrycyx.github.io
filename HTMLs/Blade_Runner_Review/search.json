["Blade Runner 2049: Technology Meets Liberal Arts CHENG Yuxiao (2018010888, Class 94) April 17, 2019 Abstract The cyberpunk sci-fi film Blade Runner 2049 hit the screen in 2017, over 30 years after its predecessor Blade Runner ’s first show. With astonishing visual effects and impres-sive details, the movie won over positive feedbacks from most critics, even though the box office results in disappointment. This review will focus on the fusion of technology and liberal arts in this movie, analyzing the reason why this masterpiece makes people wonder. Keywords: Blade Runner 2049, Cyberpunk 1 Introduction Blade Runner 2049 was directed by Denis Villeneuve, staring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. The movie sets its scene in a strange and dim environment in the year 2049 when the ecosystem has already been destroyed and ’global blackout’ has occurred. K, a replicant(People made not born) and Blade Runner, with the original job of killing (or ’retiring’) old replicants models, finds out the astonishing fact that replicant can reproduce. Figure 1: City in dark 1 ","Midterm Papre: Review for Blade Runner 2049 Figure 2: Outside the city The news attracts tremendous interests of Tyrell, replicants’ manufacturers, who want to make more replicants by cracking the secrets of fertility. Tyrell wants to find the pregnant women and her kid, while K, who thinks the kid is himself, is trying to stop them. K, together with former blade runner Rick Deckard smash their plan and end up with supporting the rise of the old replicants models. The main plot can be sophisticated, yet showing great faithfulness to the original film. In an extremely dark and dystopia environment, the viewers can still be exceedingly fascinated by the sparkling of humanism. 2 Overall Review 2.1 Visual Effect The movie was greatly praised in aspects of cinematography, winning Best Cinematography at the 90th Academy Awards Wikipedia ( 2019a ). Impressive scenes such as the orange sky, the dust, the lights in the ruins, cities, the open dump, are not only wonderful on visual, but also set a ground for the stories. Figure 3: The most visually amazing scene in the movie 2 ","Midterm Papre: Review for Blade Runner 2049 2.2 Future Technology As a cyberpunk movie Wikipedia ( 2019c ), Blade Runner 2049 emphasis on the final shape of technology: Human colonized several planets, girlfriends can be virtual, Protein can be put into batch production …At the same time, the ecosystem has been entirely destroyed, making wood the most expensive product. Surprisingly, Blade Runner 2049 threw away the cliche of sci-fi movies such as starships or laser beam. Instead, it did a great job carrying on the spiritual core of is predecessor Blade Runner , that one’s passion and love shines even in a dark, cyberpunk world. 2.3 Feminism The key part of the story is the discovery of replicants’ fertility, which is largely dominated by women (replicants). Almost never did women in a previous movie make such a great difference, since the jobs of women in other movies are mostly ’falling in love with the main characters’. In Blade Runner 2049 , the pregnant replicant Rachel and her daughter Ana Stelline basically determine the whole story: they are the reason for Tyrell’s atrocity, as well as replicants’ rise. 2.4 Humanism Joi, a not deciding yet essential part of this movie, does not belong to the replicants or human category. She’s a virtual girlfriends product manufactured by Tyrell. Sarcastically, she turns out to be the most ’human’ part. The romantic story between Joi and K, although seems ridiculous, since Joi is not biologically real, gives life to the dim background of the story. Joi goes everywhere K goes, despite all the danger of vanishing. This part matters a lot and also accounts for the humanism elements in this sci-fi movie. Figure 4: Joi, the virtual girlfriend 3 ","Midterm Papre: Review for Blade Runner 2049 3 Technology Meets Liberal Arts There are mainly 3 kinds of sci-fi: the hard ones Wikipedia ( 2019b ), which may follow a huge quantities of known physics laws and describes the future world or the space exploration, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey ; the soft ones, which may describe the variations of human thoughts and behaviors in a world with highly advanced technology, such as Blade Runner 2049 ; the fake ones, which may tell romantic stories under the framework of future world, such as Passengers . As soft science fiction, Blade Runner 2049 did a great job handling the relationship between human and technology. As a classical cyberpunk movie, it pays much attention to describing a ”combination of lowlife and high tech” Wikipedia ( 2019c ), which perfectly demonstrates the value of being a human: It’s not the DNA or the high tech but the human nature that makes us human. The real, or biologically real human, know nothing but sex and power. When news comes that replicants may reproduce, they tried everything to hunt them down. Replicants are made with many limitations, or with K’s words, ’with no soul’. While they give up their lives to protect the miracle, that is, their child. At the same time, Joi, a virtual ’human’, coded by 0 and 1 instead of A, T, G, C, loves her real boyfriend sincerely and goes wherever he goes. We should hope the future technology may not lead to disasters, but we should also hope that we would not neglect what makes us human. Just like the lines remembered by countless people in Blade Runner , that is truly what ’glitter in the darkness’ in the infinite space. References Wikipedia, t. f. e. (2019a). Blade runner 2049.
